# Error-Handling-Solidity

## Description

In this module we studied different methods in solidity for handling errors that terminate the execution of the code. Those methods are like require(), assert(), revert(). Based upon their conditions, they either continue the fuction execution or terminate it.

## Getting Started

Module 1 of ETH+AVAX course on Metacrafters is a great way to get started in learning Error Handling in solidity.

### Executing program

* Go to the online remix IDE
* Add your file and write the code in it.
* Compile and deploy the contract

## Help

For any help needed I checked into the Metacrafters Discord server and their video tutorials.
